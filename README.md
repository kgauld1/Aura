# Aura

Aura is your personal musical companion designed to monitor your emotions and generate music to fit your mood. The background gradient is also animated to match your emotions. A warm colored background signifies happy, a cool background signifies sad, and a rainbow background signifies neutral.

Using your webcam, Aura detects your mood through your facial expression, categorizing it as happy, neutral, or sad. Then, Aura uses machine learning to generate music reflective of your current emotional state. Aura can also be customized to your preferences to give you the best experience possible. Users can choose to include drums and nature sounds in addition to the instrumentals.
